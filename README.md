# Website-Scam-Predictor

***Project Description:*** In this project, Machine learning models are used to predict whether a web page is legitimate or not based on their features such as number of slash, number of comma, number of underline, etc.

***Dataset Details:*** The data set contains over 100077 records of webpages. The dataset has nineteen features (e.g., number of slash, number of comma, number of underline, etc.) and one target variable that indicates whether the web page legitimate or not.

length_url: Length of the url

num_dots: Number of dot (.) in the url

num_questionmark: Number of question mark (?) in the url

num_hypens: Number of hypen (-) in the url

num_underline: Number of underline (_) in the url

num_slash: Number of slash (/) in the url

num_equal: Number of equal (=) in the url

num_at: Number of at (@) in the url

num_and: Number of and (&) in the url

num_exclamation: Number of exclamation (!) in the url

num_space: Number of space ( ) in the url

num_tilde: Number of tilde (~) in the url

num_comma: Number of comma (,) in the url

num_plus: Number of plus (+) in the url

num_asterisk: Number of asterisk (*) in the url

num_hastag: Number of hastag (#) in the url

num_dollar: Number of dollar ($) in the url

num_percent: Number of percent (%) in the url

num_redirection: Number of redirections in the url

outcome: 1 is Phishing website, 0 is Legitimate website

The following tasks have been done:

1) *Data Exploration and Preprocessing:* Explore the data set, handle missing values, perform feature engineering, and preprocess the data to get it ready for model building.

2) *Model Building:* Train and evaluate several machine learning models on the preprocessed data set.

3) *Model Evaluation:* Evaluate the models' performance using several metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve analysis. You will also compare the models' performance and select the best-performing one.

4) *Deployment:* Deploy the best-performing model and make predictions on new, unseen data.
